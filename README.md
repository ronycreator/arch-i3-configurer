# Arch-i3-configurer

# WARNING: This project is not finished. Don't try to run the start script, but you can copy the files manually if you want
This script will configure an i3 instalation in any Arch based distro; It is meant to be powerful but without fancy configuration

It mantains i3 defaults keybinds to make easier getting started
~/.config/i3\
~/.config/i3blocks

### Must be run as sudo to work

# Features (some are not finished)
Good commented code to help new i3 users\
The script takes care for all to lazy people\
us-intl keyboard layout to write symbols outside English language easier\
All dotfiles uses ~/ (home) directories only instead of /etc and weird locations\

## The script should leave an i3 configuration looking like this (this is what it looks now):
